# psycho-space — Ops / Debugging Runbook

## LLM Continuation Context

_Machine-oriented recap for an LLM continuing this work. Written for agents, not humans — optimise for hand-off. Keep current with the doc._

- **topic:** operational runbook for the psycho-space production box (SSH, logs, DB, nginx, TLS, admin bootstrap).
- **status:** written during P0/P1. Server is provisioned by `scripts/bootstrap.sh`; deploys via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- **host/port:** intentionally NOT recorded here — this repo is public. The real host and hardened SSH port live only in the GitHub `prod` environment secrets (`DEPLOY_SSH_HOST`, `DEPLOY_SSH_PORT`) and in the operator's local `~/.ssh/config` (+ the local living doc `~/Desktop/psycho-space.md`). Use the `psycho` ssh alias below.
- **app:** systemd unit `psycho-space` under user `psychospace`; binary `/opt/psycho-space/psycho-space`; env `/etc/psycho-space/app.env`; logs `/var/log/psycho-space/app.log`.
- **code:** service in `cmd/psycho-space` + `internal/*`; deploy assets in `deploy/`; provisioning in `scripts/bootstrap.sh`.
- **local-dev:** see "Local development (game / backend)" below — `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres), `./dev.sh db-up|run|seed`, Vite on :5173. `cmd/dev-seed` mints a local approved session (VK can't run locally). Game section: LLM-judged (`internal/game/llm.go`, OpenAI-compatible), content/persona in `content.go`; requires `PSYCHOSPACE_LLM_*` env to play (else `/attempt` → 503).
- **next:** keep this current as ops procedures are exercised; add a section whenever you work out a new procedure (read-before / write-after).
- **constraints:** never commit the host/IP/port or any secret; never paste real personal data into shared places. The app log is PII-free by design; the DB and nginx access log are not — treat their contents as confidential.

---

**Do not put the host or SSH port in this file (public repo).** Configure a local `psycho` alias once; every command below uses it.

```
# ~/.ssh/config  (LOCAL, not committed) — fill from your prod secrets / living doc:
Host psycho
    HostName <server-ip-or-psycho-space.ru>
    User deploy
    Port <your-hardened-ssh-port>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_psycho
```

The dev/admin access below is for observability/debugging; production changes go through CI.

## Local development (game / backend)

Full local loop: Postgres in Docker, the Go server, and the Vite dev server with hot reload.

```bash
# one-time
mise install
cp .env.example .env         # then fill the 3 keys: openssl rand -base64 32

# every session
./dev.sh db-up               # local Postgres via docker compose (data persists in a volume)
./dev.sh run                 # Go server on :8080 (API + embedded SPA; auto-migrates on boot)
# second terminal — hot-reloading frontend:
cd web && mise exec -- npm run dev   # Vite on :5173, proxies /api + /healthz to :8080
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

### Get into the gated app without VK

VK ID is IP-allowlisted to prod and its redirect URI is the prod domain, so the real login can't run locally. Seed an approved account + session instead:

```bash
./dev.sh seed                          # superadmin "Локальный Разработчик"
./dev.sh seed -role user -name Гость   # a plain approved user
```

It prints a `psycho_session` cookie value. In the browser (DevTools → Application → Cookies) add `psycho_session=<value>` for the origin you use (`http://localhost:5173`) and reload — you land in `/app`. Or hit the API directly: `curl -b 'psycho_session=<value>' http://localhost:8080/api/auth/me`.

`dev-seed` reuses the real `crypto`/`account`/`session` packages (so hashing + encryption match prod exactly), refuses to run unless `PSYCHOSPACE_ENV=dev`, and is never built into the server binary or deployed.

### Working on the game («Смолтолк в Химках»)

It's an **LLM-judged** character dialogue: convince дядя Ваня (a strange, on-edge junkie who won't let you pass) to let you into your own entrance — over the arc you see past the addict mask to his depth (love of children, humanism) and he lets you through. Each turn the LLM replies in character, judges whether the goal is genuinely reached, picks an **art** to show (his changing mood, or a story/location art with no character — e.g. the passage into the entrance), and generates the **next answer options** (always 4 while playing). The game **requires an LLM** — no mock; unconfigured → `/attempt` returns 503.

- **Character profile is backend config**: `internal/game/content.go` — `Character` carries public bits (`name`, high-level `goal`, static `greeting` + `opening_options`, and the **`Arts` catalog**: each art's `emoji`/`gradient`/`image`) plus server-only judge material (`Objective` = the real win condition, kept off the client so it isn't spoiled; `Motivation`/`Persona`/`TalkStyle`). **Opening is static** — the greeting + first options render with no LLM call; the judge takes over from the player's first pick (the greeting is seeded into the model's context). Subsequent options are LLM-generated. Edit + restart `./dev.sh run`; the SPA fetches `GET /api/game/config`.
- **Assets resolve from the backend catalog** — `Character.Arts`. The judge returns an art *key*; the SPA renders the matching descriptor. Adding/altering arts is backend-only; no client change.
- **Turns are judged by the LLM** in `internal/game/llm.go` (`openAIEvaluator`, OpenAI-compatible: Yandex Cloud / DeepSeek). `POST /api/game/attempt {game_key, character_key, transcript:[{choice,reply}], choice}` → `{reply, art, achieved, options[]}` (`choice:""` = opening turn). The full transcript is sent to the model, trimmed to a ~32k-token window (older exchanges forgotten — `maxContextTokens`).
- **Config** (start target: **YandexGPT 5 Lite**): `PSYCHOSPACE_LLM_BASE_URL=https://llm.api.cloud.yandex.net/v1`, `PSYCHOSPACE_LLM_API_KEY=<key>`, `PSYCHOSPACE_LLM_MODEL=gpt://<folder-id>/yandexgpt-5-lite` (full model URI, folder-specific). Set all three to activate; creds arrive via GH secrets. Context window 32768 (`modelContextTokens`), ~2k reserved for output.
- **Runs** (`{success, steps}`) are recorded via `POST /api/game/runs` and feed the leaderboard (`/runs/leaderboard` — successes + total steps per player) and stats (`/runs/me`).
- Files: LLM judge `internal/game/llm.go`; content `content.go`; UI `web/src/views/GameView.vue` (turn loop, portrait + landscape, art from catalog); `gameApi` in `web/src/api/endpoints.ts`; migration `migrations/005_game_runs.sql`.

### Game assets (generation & packaging)

Each art in the catalog needs an image. **Placeholders (emoji + gradient) render until real images land** — adding images is backend-only, no client change.

**Names — derive from the art catalog** (source of truth: `internal/game/content.go`, `Character.Arts`). The required filenames are exactly the art keys per game:

- from the API: `curl -s -b <cookie> 'http://localhost:8080/api/game/config?game=smalltalk_khimki' | jq -r '.characters[].arts[].key'`
- or read the `Arts: []Art{…}` block in `content.go`.

Current game `smalltalk_khimki` — 8 arts (file name = `<key>.webp`):

| key | what |
|-----|------|
| `entrance_far_angry` | подъезд издалека, злой дядя Ваня (establishing) |
| `vanya_angry` | дядя Ваня — злой, крупно |
| `vanya_suspicious` | подозрительный |
| `vanya_neutral` | нейтральный |
| `vanya_warming` | теплеет |
| `vanya_deep` | раскрывается глубина |
| `memory_children` | сюжетный арт-воспоминание, без персонажа |
| `hallway_pass` | проход в подъезд, без дяди Вани (финал) |

Two kinds: **character-mood** (`vanya_*`) — the same дядя Ваня, changing expression; **story/location** (`entrance_far_angry`, `memory_children`, `hallway_pass`) — scene, no character in focus.

**Size & format:**

- **1024×1024 px** square is the default (rendered `object-fit: contain`, so it never crops — letterboxes in wide/short panes). Location arts may be **1280×768** landscape if you prefer full-bleed scenes.
- **WebP** (preferred) or PNG; keep each **≤ ~250 KB** — mobile downloads them on demand.
- Keep the character consistent across a game's `*_*` arts; gritty tragicomic RU-двор tone.

**Where they live — Postgres blob store (NOT the repo/binary):**

- Table `game_assets` (`game_key`, `art_key`, `content_type`, `bytes`), migration `006_game_assets.sql`. Kept out of git so the art doesn't bloat the repo/binary.
- Served by `GET /api/game/assets/{game}/{key}` — **public**, `Cache-Control: max-age=86400`; the client downloads each art on demand and caches it. No CDN.
- `GET /api/game/config` advertises an image URL **only for arts that have an uploaded blob**; arts without one keep the emoji placeholder, so partial uploads degrade gracefully. `Art.Image` in `content.go` stays empty — the config handler fills it per uploaded key.

**Upload (owner-only, over SSH for now — an admin UI may come later):**

`deploy/upload-game-assets.py` converts each image in a dir to WebP and prints
`INSERT … ON CONFLICT` SQL to stdout; pipe it to a psql. Requires Pillow
(`pip install pillow`).

```bash
# prod (hardened SSH alias `psycho`):
python3 deploy/upload-game-assets.py ~/Desktop/vanya_assets \
  | ssh psycho "sudo -u postgres psql psychospace"

# local dev DB:
python3 deploy/upload-game-assets.py ~/Desktop/vanya_assets \
  | psql "postgres://psychospace:psychospace@localhost:5432/psychospace"
```

- Art key = filename without extension; it **must** match a key in `content.go`. Re-running upserts. Remove one with `DELETE FROM game_assets WHERE game_key='…' AND art_key='…'`.
- After upload, reload the game — the config now serves the real images (`<img>` in `GameView.vue`; falls back to the emoji if a load fails).

### Tests

```bash
./dev.sh test          # Go unit (incl. internal/game)
./dev.sh integration   # testcontainers (incl. test/integration/game_test.go)
./dev.sh web           # frontend type-check + vitest
./dev.sh pre-commit    # everything (the git hook runs this)
```

## Service

```bash
ssh psycho 'systemctl status psycho-space'
ssh psycho 'sudo systemctl restart psycho-space'      # rarely needed; CI restarts on deploy
ssh psycho 'journalctl -u psycho-space -n 200 --no-pager'
ssh psycho 'journalctl -u psycho-space -f'            # live
```

## Logs (host files, rotated)

The app writes structured JSON to `/var/log/psycho-space/app.log` (rotated by size, 7 backups, 30 days) in addition to journald.

```bash
ssh psycho 'tail -f /var/log/psycho-space/app.log' | jq .
ssh psycho 'grep http_request /var/log/psycho-space/app.log | tail -50' | jq .
# Correlate a specific account without exposing PII (we log vk_user_ref hex, never names):
ssh psycho 'grep <ref-hex-prefix> /var/log/psycho-space/app.log'
```

## Database

```bash
# Interactive shell (as the DB superuser on the box):
ssh psycho 'sudo -u postgres psql psychospace'

# One-off query:
ssh psycho "sudo -u postgres psql psychospace -c 'SELECT status, count(*) FROM accounts GROUP BY status;'"

# Pending accounts (to approve) — note the short handle shown to the user on the pending screen:
ssh psycho "sudo -u postgres psql psychospace -c \
  \"SELECT left(encode(vk_user_ref,'hex'),8) AS handle, role, status, created_at FROM accounts WHERE status='pending' ORDER BY created_at;\""

# Wishlist vote counts:
ssh psycho "sudo -u postgres psql psychospace -c \
  \"SELECT i.title, count(v.*) AS votes FROM wishlist_items i \
    LEFT JOIN wishlist_votes v ON v.item_id=i.id AND v.deleted_at IS NULL \
    WHERE i.deleted_at IS NULL GROUP BY i.id ORDER BY votes DESC;\""
```

Profile fields are stored encrypted (`*_enc` bytea) and are **not** readable from SQL — that's by design (152-ФЗ). `\x` on a row shows only ciphertext.

## DB access from a local GUI (JetBrains DataGrip / DB plugin)

Postgres listens only on the server's `127.0.0.1:5432`; reach it through an SSH tunnel — nothing on the server needs changing (the `deploy` user can forward, and TCP forwarding stays enabled after hardening).

**JetBrains (DataGrip / IDEA Database tool):** New Data Source → PostgreSQL, then:

- **SSH/SSL tab → Use SSH tunnel:** Host = the server IP/domain, Port = the hardened SSH port, User = `deploy`, Auth = Key pair → your `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_psycho`.
- **General tab:** Host = `127.0.0.1`, Port = `5432`, Database = `psychospace`, User = `psychospace`, Password = the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` value. (The IDE resolves `127.0.0.1` on the *server side* of the tunnel.)

**Plain CLI equivalent** (local port 5433 → server's 5432):

```bash
ssh -p <hardened-port> -N -L 5433:127.0.0.1:5432 deploy@<server-ip>   # leave running
psql "postgres://psychospace:<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>@127.0.0.1:5433/psychospace?sslmode=disable"
```

Treat everything you pull this way as confidential; profile columns are ciphertext regardless.

## Superadmin bootstrap (first login)

The **superadmin** is created once via script; only the superadmin can promote other users to **admin** in-app (admins can approve/revoke but not mint admins).

1. Owner logs in via VK once → sees a **pending** screen with a short code (the first 8 hex of their `vk_user_ref`).
2. Promote that account to superadmin + approved:

```bash
ssh psycho 'sudo /usr/local/bin/make-superadmin <handle>'   # deployed helper, or the SQL directly:
ssh psycho "sudo -u postgres psql psychospace -c \
  \"UPDATE accounts SET role='superadmin', status='approved', updated_at=now() \
    WHERE encode(vk_user_ref,'hex') LIKE '<handle>%';\""
```

3. Reload the app — the owner now has the admin page to approve people and promote admins.

## nginx & TLS

```bash
ssh psycho 'sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx'
ssh psycho 'sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log'
ssh psycho 'sudo certbot certificates'          # cert status/expiry
ssh psycho 'sudo systemctl status certbot.timer' # auto-renewal
```

## Health

```bash
curl -fsS https://psycho-space.ru/healthz        # {"status":"ok"}
curl -fsS https://psycho-space.ru/api/ping        # {"message":"pong"}
```

## Fail2ban / SSH

```bash
ssh psycho 'sudo fail2ban-client status sshd'
ssh psycho 'sudo ss -tlnp'                        # confirm sshd is on the hardened port only
```

**Ubuntu 24.04 note:** sshd is run as the standalone `ssh.service` with `ssh.socket`
**disabled** — socket activation ignores the `Port` directive in `sshd_config`, so
the hardened port only works with the socket off. `bootstrap.sh`/`harden-finalize.sh`
handle this; if sshd ever reverts to listening only on 22, run
`sudo systemctl disable --now ssh.socket && sudo systemctl restart ssh.service`.

## SSH recovery / re-enabling root

Hardening disables root SSH **login** (`PermitRootLogin no`) and closes port 22 — it
does **not** remove or lock the root account. Recovery, in order of preference:

1. **`deploy` has full sudo — the normal path.** `ssh -p <port> deploy@<ip>` then
   `sudo -i` for a root shell. To re-enable root SSH login:
   ```bash
   sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin .*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99-psycho.conf
   sudo sshd -t && sudo systemctl restart ssh
   sudo ufw allow 22/tcp     # only if you also want port 22 reopened
   ```
2. **Provider console (VNC / serial / recovery mode)** in the hosting panel — the
   ultimate fallback if SSH is entirely unreachable; logs in as root locally,
   bypassing SSH. Use it to undo any sshd/ufw change that locked you out.

You rarely need root over SSH — `deploy` + sudo covers all admin.
